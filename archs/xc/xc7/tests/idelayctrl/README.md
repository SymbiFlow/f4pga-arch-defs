IDELAYCTRL placement test
=========================

This test is purely intended to check the correct placement constraints to the IDELAYCTRL sites without
the need of specifying the LOC attributes in the design.

The test checks whether the final FASM file does contain the correct features that enable the REFCLK on the
IDELAYCTRL sites at the right location.
